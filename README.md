# NTA_using_wireshark
Abstract

This project is focused on capturing, analyzing, and interpreting network traffic using Wireshark and PyShark (a Python wrapper for TShark). By analyzing packet-level network traffic either in real time or from previously captured files, the project provides valuable insights into the types of protocols in use, the volume of traffic exchanged, and possible signs of malicious or abnormal activity. It aims to assist network administrators, security analysts, and learners in better understanding network behavior and detecting potential threats through automated analysis.
